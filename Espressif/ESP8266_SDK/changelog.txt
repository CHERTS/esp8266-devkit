esp_iot_sdk_v0.9.5_15_01_22 Release Note
----------------------------------------

AT becomes a lib attached to esp_iot_sdk, programming guide in "document" shows APIs for user to define their own AT commands, AT bin files are in \esp_iot_sdk\bin\at

Fix bugs:
1. Incorrect status got by API : wifi_station_get_connect_status;
2. Sniffer can not quit without restart;
3. wifi_station_ap_change always return true;
4. TCP connection issues

Add APIs:
1. system_deep_sleep_set_option: set what the chip will do when deep-sleep wake up;
2. wifi_status_led_uninstall;
3. wifi_station_ap_get_info: get information of AP that ESP8266 station connected.
4. wifi_station_dhcpc_status & wifi_softap_dhcps_status : get DHCP status
5. smart config APIs, more details in documents.
6. add beacon_interval parameter in struct softap_config
7. espconn_recv_hold and espconn_recv_unhold to block TCP receiving data and unblock it.
8. AT APIs to let user define their own AT, more details in documents.

Optimize:
1. light sleep, modem sleep, deep sleep
2. compile method: ./gen_misc.sh, then follow the tips and steps.
3. when no buffer for os_malloc, return NULL instead of malloc assert.
4. users can enable #define USE_OPTIMIZE_PRINTF in user_config.h to remove strings of os_printf from ram to irom
5. faster the re-connection of ESP8266 station to router after deep-sleep.
6. update to boot v1.2 to support new format user.bin;
7. update ARP
8. update SSL
9. revised system_deep_sleep,system_deep_sleep(0),set no wake up timer,connect a GPIO to pin RST, the chip will wake up by a falling-edge on pin RST 

esp_iot_sdk_v0.9.4_14_12_19 Release Note
----------------------------------------

1. Update sniffer to support capture HT20/HT40 packet;
2. Add APIs to set and get sleep type;
3. Add APIs to get version info of sdk, delete version.h;
4. RAW in LWIP is open source now, add API of function ping;
5. Update spi driver;
6. Optimize APIs related to espconn;
7. Fix some bugs to make the software more reliable;

Known Issue:
1. exception of small probability occured while recving multi-client data in softap
2. restart of small probability occured while tcp client reconnecting

So sorry that we have some known issues here, we will solve it ASAP.

esp_iot_sdk_v0.9.3_14_11_21 Release Note
----------------------------------------

1. Add license documentation of ESPRESSIF SDK
2. Add APIs to read and write RTC memory, and APIs to get RTC time.
3. Add APIs to swap UART0
4. Add API to read ADC, delete adc.c.
5. Add API to read spi flash id
6. Revise struct station_config, add bssid parameters to distinguish different AP with same ssid ;
   Note: if station_config.bssid_set == 1 , station_config.bssid has to be set, or connection will fail. So in general, station_config.bssid_set need to be 0.
7. Revise struct scan_config, add scan_config.show_hidden to set whether scan APs which ssid is hidden or not; not scan, set scan_config.show_hidden to be 0.
   Add bss_info.is_hidden in struct bss_info to show if this APTs ssid is hidden.
8. Revise struct softap_config, add softap_config.ssid_len. If softap_config.ssid_len == 0, check ssid till find a termination characters; otherwise it depends on softap_config.ssid_len.
9. Revise API "wifi_softap_set_config" to take effect immediately, needs not restart to make the configuration enable any more.
10. Add APIs to set and get physical layer mode(802.11b/g/n)
11. Add APIs to enable and disable DHCP server of ESP8266 softAP
12. Add APIs to enable and disable DHCP client of ESP8266 station
13. Add API to set range of ip address that get from DHCP server
14. Add APIs to set and get how many TCP connections allowed at max.
15. Add APIs to set and get how many TCP clients allowed at max to a TCP server.
16. Revise "wifi_set_ip_info" and "wifi_set_macaddr" to take effect immediately.
17. Fix some bugs to make the software more reliable.

ESP8266EX: Fix A Potential Error For UART RX in esp_iot_sdk_v0.9.2_14_10_24
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The previously released SDK for ESP8266EX inadvertently introduced a bug that may cause a little packet loss when transferring packet by Uart RX.
So for now,I will release the patch for this bug.Please download the patch from the attachment,and refer to the following steps:
Following Commands:
1. REPLACE LIBPHY.A IN SDK/LIB
2. ADD LIBPP.A TO SDK/LIB
3. MODIFY SDK/APP/MAKEFILE
4. ADD "-lpp \" AS BELOW
-lgcc
-lhal
-lpp
-lphy
-lnet80211
-llwip
-lwpa
-lmain
-lssc
-lssl

esp_iot_sdk_v0.9.2_14_10_24 Release Note
----------------------------------------

Initial version for public, can be compiled on both windows and lubuntu.
